# LinSysadTool
This is an ongoing build of a Sysadmin tool for Linux. Particularly tested in Debian/Parrot OS.

Please note that as of right now the tool is incomplete and is experimental. Use at your own risk. This is an experiment to help me learn Python3 while contributing to a tool that I can use in the future as I need it.
